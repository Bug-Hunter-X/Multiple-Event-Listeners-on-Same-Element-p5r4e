This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error involving multiple event listeners attached to the same element using different methods (directly assigning to the `onclick` property and using `addEventListener`).  The error may result in unexpected behavior when the element is triggered, such as multiple alerts firing. The solution showcases the correct method of adding event listeners to avoid this issue.
